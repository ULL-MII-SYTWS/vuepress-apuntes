# The JavaScript Render Queue

The **JavaScript render queue** refers to the process by which the browser schedules and manages rendering tasks 
(like [painting, layout, and compositing](painting-layout-compositing)) alongside JavaScript execution. Understanding the render queue requires a basic knowledge of how the **browser's event loop** operates, and how rendering is handled within this loop.

### Key Concepts:
1. **JavaScript and the Event Loop**:
   - JavaScript is **single-threaded**, meaning it executes one task at a time.
   - The browser uses an **event loop** to manage JavaScript execution and other tasks (like rendering, handling user inputs, network requests, etc.).
   - The event loop consists of two main phases:
     - **JavaScript execution** (task queue)
     - **Rendering updates** (render queue)

2. **The Render Queue**:
   - The **render queue** is responsible for updating the **visual representation** of the page (e.g., painting elements, updating the layout, etc.).
   - The browser attempts to render the page at a regular interval (typically every 16.67ms, aiming for 60 frames per second).
   - **Rendering tasks** include layout recalculation, style application, painting (drawing pixels on the screen), and compositing (combining layers).

3. **How It Works**:
   - After **JavaScript code** executes (or when an event, like a user interaction, triggers a reflow), the browser places a **render task** in the queue for the next rendering frame.
   - The browser may **batch rendering tasks** together for efficiency to avoid unnecessary layouts and paints. For example, if you make multiple DOM changes in quick succession, the browser will likely group these updates together before re-rendering.
   - JavaScript can **block rendering** if it runs too long, which is why long-running tasks or heavy computations can cause the page to appear unresponsive ([jank](jank)).
   - The rendering process generally occurs **after** JavaScript execution and before the next frame is displayed.

4. **Frame Rendering**:
   - The browser tries to maintain a consistent **frame rate** (typically 60fps) by ensuring that both JavaScript execution and rendering are completed within the 16.67ms time window.
   - After the JavaScript task queue is cleared, the browser checks for **style recalculations, layout changes, and paint operations**. If necessary, these rendering tasks are processed.
   - After the rendering phase, the browser will display the updated frame on the screen.

5. **Impact of JavaScript on Rendering**:
   - If JavaScript takes too long to run, it can delay the rendering process, causing the browser to miss a frame, which results in **jank** (stuttering or slow visual updates).
   - JavaScript updates that modify the **DOM** or **CSSOM** (like changing element sizes or styles) will force the browser to recalculate layout and potentially repaint the screen.
   - The browser is optimized to **batch DOM changes** whenever possible, and only repaint the screen after JavaScript execution finishes.

### Interaction Between JavaScript and Rendering:

1. **Reflows and Repaints**:
   - **Reflows** (or layout recalculations) happen when an element's size, position, or dimensions are changed, forcing the browser to recalculate the layout for affected elements.
   - **Repaints** occur when changes to visual elements (like colors, visibility, or text) do not require recalculating the layout but do require updating pixels on the screen.

2. **Optimizing for Performance**:
   - Minimize DOM manipulations in tight loops or rapidly executed code, as they can trigger multiple reflows and repaints, which may negatively impact performance.
   - Use techniques like **debouncing** or **throttling** to limit how often JavaScript updates that affect rendering are processed.
   - Consider using `requestAnimationFrame()` for smooth animations. This function allows JavaScript to schedule code to run **before the next repaint**, ensuring the code is executed in sync with the browser's rendering cycle.

3. **Microtasks vs Macrotasks**:
   - **Microtasks** (like `Promise` callbacks) run immediately after the current task finishes, before the browser has a chance to render.
   - **Macrotasks** (like `setTimeout`) get queued to run after rendering, ensuring smoother interaction with the render cycle.

### Example:
Letâ€™s consider an example where you modify the DOM inside a loop:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('div'));
}
```

- Each DOM change in the loop might cause a **layout recalculation** and **repaint**, which is inefficient. The browser may optimize this by batching multiple updates, but if the loop is complex or involves heavy calculations, it could cause jank.
  
In contrast, if you use `document.createDocumentFragment()` to append multiple elements at once, the browser can handle these changes more efficiently by updating the layout and rendering only once.
