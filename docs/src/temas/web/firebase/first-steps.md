# Add Firebase to your JavaScript project

See [the guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup)  to use the Firebase JavaScript SDK in your web app or as a client for end-user access, for example, in a Node.js application.

If you don't already have a JavaScript project and just want to try out a Firebase product, you can download one of our 
[quickstart samples](https://firebase.google.com/docs/samples).
