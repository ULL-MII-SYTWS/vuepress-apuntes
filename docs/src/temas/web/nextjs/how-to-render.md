# When to Use Static Generation v.s. Server-side Rendering

See section [When to Use Static Generation v.s. Server-side Rendering](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/data-fetching/two-forms) of the Next.js tutorial:

1. You should ask yourself: "Can I pre-render this page ahead of a user's request?" 
   * If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.
   * If you cannot pre-render a page ahead of user's requests and the page content changes on every request, use Server-side Rendering. It will be slower, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. 
   * Use client-side JavaScript to populate frequently updated data (for instance: the view changes often in terms of the user and the internet connection is slow).

## What is the difference between SSR an Server Side Component?

The main difference between Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Server Components lies in their approach to rendering and their place in the application lifecycle. Let me break it down for you:

1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR):


SSR is a technique where the initial HTML of a page is generated on the server for each request . When a user makes a request to your site, your server generates the HTML at that time (runtime) and then returns the HTML, JSON data, and JavaScript instructions back to the client's browser .

Key characteristics of SSR:

- The entire page is rendered on the server for the initial request.
- The server sends a fully formed HTML page to the client.
- After the initial load, subsequent interactions may be handled client-side.
- SSR can improve initial page load times and is beneficial for SEO.


2. Server Components:

Server Components, on the other hand, are a more recent innovation, particularly associated with React and frameworks like Next.js. They allow you to render specific components on the server .

Key characteristics of Server Components:

- They execute in a separate module system from Client Components to avoid accidentally exposing information between the two .
- They can access server-side resources directly (like databases or file systems) without exposing sensitive information to the client.
- They can reduce the amount of JavaScript sent to the client, as their rendering logic stays on the server.
- They can be used alongside Client Components in the same application.

::: tip The main differences

1. Granularity: SSR typically renders entire pages on the server, while Server Components allow for component-level server-side rendering.
2. Interactivity: SSR pages become interactive after the JavaScript loads on the client, while Server Components can coexist with interactive Client Components from the start.
3. Data fetching: With SSR, data is typically fetched for the entire page. Server Components allow for more granular data fetching at the component level.
4. Performance: Server Components can potentially offer better performance by reducing the amount of JavaScript sent to the client and allowing for more efficient updates.
5. Development model: Server Components introduce a new mental model for developers, allowing them to think about server-side and client-side logic at the component level.
:::

In modern frameworks like Next.js, you can use both SSR and Server Components together to create efficient and performant applications. Server Components represent a more fine-grained approach to server-side rendering, offering developers more control over what gets rendered on the server versus the client.

## Can exists a Client Side Component which is server side rendered? Does it makes sense?

A Client-Side Component can indeed be server-side rendered, and it does make sense in certain contexts. This concept is particularly relevant in frameworks like Next.js that support both Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Client-Side Rendering (CSR). 
Now, here's how they can work together:

1. Initial Render:
When a user first requests a page, the server can render the entire page, including Client-Side Components, into HTML. This is the "server-side rendered" part .
1. **Hydration**:
After the initial HTML is sent to the browser, the JavaScript for these Client-Side Components is also sent. **The components then "hydrate", attaching event listeners and becoming fully interactive**.


This approach combines the benefits of both worlds:

- Fast initial page load and better SEO from SSR
- Rich interactivity of Client-Side Components after hydration


In Next.js, this is actually a common pattern. By default, pages are pre-rendered (either at build time or on each request), but they can include Client Components that become interactive after the JavaScript loads .

Here's a simplified example of how this might look in Next.js:

```jsx
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

This `Counter` component is a Client Component (note the `'use client'` directive). However, when used in a Next.js page:

1. It will be initially rendered on the server as static HTML
2. When loaded in the browser, it will hydrate and become interactive


Yes, a Client-Side Component can be server-side rendered, and it makes sense as a strategy to combine the benefits of SSR (faster initial load, SEO) with the interactivity of client-side components.
