## Introduction to Monorepos. Nextra as an example


::: tip 📚 Monorepo Definition 
A **monorepo** is a single repository containing multiple distinct projects , with well-defined relationships between them.
One of the main reasons for using a monorepo is to have a single source of truth for all projects. This means that all projects can be kept in sync and changes can be made across all projects in a single commit. 
When working in JavaScript and Node.js projects, monorepos are often used to manage multiple packages that are published to npm.
This is the case of Nextra.

You can see that is a monorepo for the presence of a `packages` directory in the root of the project containing three npm related packages:
::: 

```bash
➜  nextra git:(casiano) ✗ tree -L 1 packages
packages
├── nextra
├── nextra-theme-blog
└── nextra-theme-docs
```

Also you can see in the Nextra `package.json` that the project depends on the npm module [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/tree/main#readme), which is also a monorepo!. 

::: tip 📚 Changesets
**Changesets** is a concept that hold two bits of information: 
1. A version type (following [semver](https://semver.org/)), and 
2. Change information to be added to a changelog. 
   
In a monorepo context, changesets will handle bumping dependencies of changed packages.
::: 


There is a configuration file `.changeset/config.json ` that specifies the packages that are part of the monorepo:

```js
➜  nextra git:(casiano) ✗ cat .changeset/config.json 
{
  "$schema": "https://unpkg.com/@changesets/config@2.0.1/schema.json",
  "changelog": "@changesets/cli/changelog",
  "commit": false,
  "fixed": [["nextra", "nextra-theme-docs", "nextra-theme-blog"]],
  "linked": [],
  "access": "public",
  "baseBranch": "main",
  "updateInternalDependencies": "patch",
  "___experimentalUnsafeOptions_WILL_CHANGE_IN_PATCH": {
    "onlyUpdatePeerDependentsWhenOutOfRange": true
  },
  "ignore": ["example-blog", "example-docs", "swr-site", "docs"]
}
```

The overall changeset cycle after initialization should lead is a loop that looks like:

1. Changesets added along with each change
2. The `version` command is run when a release is ready, and the changes are verified
3. The `publish` command is run afterwards.

See the changesets [glossary](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/dictionary.md).

## Instructions 

See and follow the instructions in the [README.md](https://github.com/gh-cli-for-education/nextra/blob/casiano/README.md) 
in the branch `casiano` at the fork of the [Nextra monorepo](https://github.com/gh-cli-for-education/nextra/tree/casiano).

The Nextra repository uses [PNPM Workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) and
[Turborepo](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo). To install dependencies, run
`pnpm install` in the project root directory.

## Installation. Turborepo and PNPM Workspaces

Worked with node v22.2.0 but not with v23.0.0:

```
➜  nextra-theme-docs git:(casiano) ✗ node --version
v22.2.0
```

The Nextra repository uses [PNPM Workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) and
[Turborepo](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo). 

### Turborepo

Turborepo uses [remote cache stores](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) via providers like [Vercel](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching#vercel) to cache the result of tasks like `npm run build`, so that CI tasks avoid to do the same work twice. Other tasks are test, lint...
It parallelizes work across all available cores.
It uses the `package.json` scripts, the dependencies you've already declared, and a single `turbo.json` file. 


`➜  nextra git:(casiano) ✗ cat turbo.json`

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
  "tasks": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": [
        // Run `build` in workspaces I depend on first
        "^build"
      ],
      "outputs": ["dist/**", ".next/**"]
    },
    "build:tailwind": {
      "dependsOn": [],
      "outputs": ["style.css"]
    },
    "test": {
      "outputs": ["dist/**"]
    },
    "types:check": {
      "dependsOn": [
        // Run `build` in workspaces I depend on first
        "^build"
      ],
      "outputs": ["dist/**", ".next/**"]
    },
    "clean": {
      "cache": false
    },
    "dev": {
      "dependsOn": [
        // Run `build` in workspaces I depend on first
        "^build"
      ],
      "cache": false
    }
  }
}
```

### pnpm Workspaces

[pnpm has built-in support for monorepositories](https://pnpm.io/workspaces). You can create a workspace to unite multiple projects inside a single repository. A workspace must have a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file in its root. A workspace also may have an .npmrc in its root.

```bash
➜  nextra git:(casiano) ✗ cat pnpm-workspace.yaml 
packages:
  - packages/*
  - examples/*
  - docs

➜  nextra git:(casiano) ✗ cat .npmrc 
strict-peer-dependencies=false
shell-emulator=true
```
### Installation

To install dependencies, run
`pnpm install` in the project root directory.

## Build Nextra Core

```bash
cd packages/nextra
pnpm build
```

Watch mode: `pnpm dev`

## Build Nextra Theme

```bash
cd packages/nextra-theme-docs
pnpm build
```

## Development

### Running the package nextra in watch mode 

Set `nvm use v22`. I went to the `packages/nextra` directory and run `pnpm dev`. It uses [tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev/) a utility to bundle TypeScript code.

### Running the package nextra-theme-docs in watch mode

I opened a new terminal; set `nvm use v22` and then went to the `packages/nextra-theme-docs` directory. 

```bash
➜  nextra git:(casiano) ✗ cd packages/nextra-theme-docs 
```

I run `pnpm dev`. 
It concurrently runs 

- `tsup --watch` and 
- `TAILWIND_MODE=watch pnpm postcss css/styles.css -o dist/style.css --watch`.

Here are the scripts in the `package.json` file:

`➜  nextra-theme-docs git:(casiano) ✗ jq '.scripts' package.json`

```json 
{
  "build": "tsup",
  "build:all": "pnpm build && pnpm build:tailwind",
  "build:tailwind": "pnpm postcss css/styles.css -o dist/style.css --verbose",
  "clean": "rimraf ./dist ./style.css",
  "dev": "concurrently \"pnpm dev:layout\" \"pnpm dev:tailwind\"",
  "dev:layout": "tsup --watch",
  "dev:tailwind": "TAILWIND_MODE=watch pnpm postcss css/styles.css -o dist/style.css --watch",
  "prepublishOnly": "pnpm build:all",
  "test": "vitest run",
  "types": "tsup --dts-only",
  "types:check": "tsc --noEmit"
}
```

The table below shows the description of some of the available scripts:

| Command           | Description              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| pnpm dev          | Watch mode               |
| pnpm dev:layout   | Watch mode (layout only) |
| pnpm dev:tailwind | Watch mode (style only)  |

### Running the example docs in watch mode

I opened a new terminal; set `nvm use v22` and then went to `examples/docs` and run:

```console
➜  docs git:(casiano) ✗ pnpm dev

> example-docs@ dev /Users/casianorodriguezleon/campus-virtual/2223/learning/nextjs-learning/nextra-learning/nextra/examples/docs
> next

⚠ Port 3000 is in use, trying 3001 instead.
⚠ Port 3001 is in use, trying 3002 instead.
⚠ Port 3002 is in use, trying 3003 instead.
  ▲ Next.js 15.0.1
  - Local:        http://localhost:3003

✓ Starting...
  automatically enabled Fast Refresh for 2 custom loaders
✓ Ready in 4.5s
```

Any changes to `example/docs` will be re-rendered instantly.

Here we have used the watch mode for both nextra and the theme in separated terminals.
Otherwise, if you update the core or theme packages, a rebuild is required. 

### Watching the propagation of the changes 

Now, go to file `packages/nextra/src/client/components/callout.tsx` and change the `TypeToEmoji` object and modify the warning emoji
for `warning` to '👀' (eye emoji).

`packages/nextra/src/client/components/callout.tsx` 

```ts
const TypeToEmoji = {
  default: '💡',
  error: '🚫',
  info: <InformationCircleIcon className="_mt-1" />,
  warning: ' 👀' // '⚠️'
}
```
Now in the file 
`/examples/docs/src/pages/themes/docs/callout.mdx` you have an example of usage of the `callout` component with the `type` attribute set to `warning`:

````md
### Warning

<Callout type="warning">This API will be deprecated soon.</Callout>

```mdx
<Callout type="warning">This API will be deprecated soon.</Callout>
```
````

When we go to the browser to somehting like `http://localhost:3002/themes/docs/callout` and refresh the page we see the eyes emoji in the warning callout:

![warning callout](/images/nextra/warning-callout.png)
