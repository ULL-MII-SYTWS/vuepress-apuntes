## Tutorial on Open AI REST API

In the previous version of this lab we used Next.js 12 and the old version of the Open AI REST API (npm module version 3.0). You can follow [2022 version of this lab](/assets/practicas/nextjs/nextjs-2022). The repo you obtained from the assignment is based on that versions.

If you prefer, you can optionally change the goals required in the [2022 version](/assets/practicas/nextjs/nextjs-2022) of this lab for implementing the prompt engineering agent described in the previous lab [prompt engineering](/practicas/prompt-engineering)
