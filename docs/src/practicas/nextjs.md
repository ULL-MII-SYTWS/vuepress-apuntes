## NextJS current version

Go to <https://nextjs.org/docs> and follow the course for the current version of Next.js. Create a folder `nextjs-quickstart` and inside it follow the steps in the tutorial.

## Vercel AI SDK Quickstart Guide

Follow also the tutorial at repo <https://github.com/ULL-prompt-engineering/vercel-sdk-ai-quickstart>. 
It is based on the Vercel AI SDK [Quickstart Guide](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/getting-started).
Create a folder `vercel-sdk-ai-quickstart` and inside it follow the steps in the tutorial.

## Tutorial on Open AI REST API

In the previous version of this lab we used Next.js 12 and the old version of the Open AI REST API. You can follow [2022 version of this lab](/assets/practicas/nextjs/nextjs-2022). The template you are using is based on that version.

For this version you can implement the prompt engineering agent described in previous lab [prompt engineering](/practicas/prompt-engineering)
