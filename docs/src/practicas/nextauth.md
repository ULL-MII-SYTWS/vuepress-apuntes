## Introducción

This lab will be delivered in the same repo associated with the [Nextra](/practices/nextra) lab. Create a branch `nextra` to point to the delivery point of the previous lab and be sure to push that branch to the remote of the assignment. Deliver this task in the `main` branch.

The task is to add authentication to the Nextra Site using NextAuth.js.
