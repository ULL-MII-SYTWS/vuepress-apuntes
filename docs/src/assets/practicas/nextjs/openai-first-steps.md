# OpenAI First Steps

## Creating an Account

[Create an account at openai api](https://openai.com/api/). Unfortunately, at some point is going to ask you for a phone number:

It does not provide any alternatives. Let me know in advance if this is a problem for you.

## Generating an API key


Go to the user on the upper right corner and click on the API Keys tab.

 Click on the "Create new secret Key" button and copy the key.


## REST exercises

Make requests to the OpenAI API using a client like the Thunder Client or Postman or Insomnia.

1. To get all models
2. To get info of a model
3. To get a cute image
4. To get a completion
5. To get a moderation

See <https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/>
