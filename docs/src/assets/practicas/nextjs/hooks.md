## React Hooks

[Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) are functions that let you *hook into* 
React **state** and **lifecycle** features from function components.

React provides a few built-in Hooks like `useState`. 

You can also create your own Hooks to reuse stateful behavior between different components.

The Effect Hook, `useEffect`, adds the ability to perform *side effects* from a function component. 
Some examples of side effects are: fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and timers.
